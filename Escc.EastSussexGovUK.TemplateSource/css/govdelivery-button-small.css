/* At small sizes, show a tab dropping down from the top of the screen. 
    
   At really tiny sizes there's only room for an icon, so use image replacement technique http://www.sitepoint.com/new-css-image-replacement-technique/, but add text as soon as we can.

   The 'right' position is expressed in ems so that it moves left as the 'Contact us' link grows when text size is increased. 
   The 'width' is also expressed in ems so that the background grows with the text of the button.
   This is done by eye rather than as grid columns because the width of a grid column varies as the browser is resized, but the size of an em doesn't respond to that.
